Lists

when setting the list style to "circle inside", the bullets changed to hollow circles
the "circle outside" setting was applied, the bullets are solid circles
the "square" setting creates square bullets
applying "none" makes the bullets disappear
the 2px red border surrounds the list when you set the width, style, and color
setting the padding to 10px gives more space between the list and the red border
setting the left padding to 40px increases the space between the text and the left margin
removing the left padding and setting the padding to 0 leaves no space between the border and the text
Adding a 1 px black dashed border to the list1 li set created a dashed grid for the text in the list
10 px of padding puts space between the grid items
changing the margin to 20px and width to 200px puts the dashed border only around the list items and allows for space in between each one
the inline display property puts the list items in a horizontal line instead of vertical
the block display property put thems back into a vertical line
inline block property makes larger blocks than the inline display property and the list items are in a horizontal line

Floats
when adding the float property "right" the elemnents change to be side by side
the side by side elements shift to the left when adding a "left" float property
div1 float right makes and div2 float left puts the elements hugging the right and left sides of the page
